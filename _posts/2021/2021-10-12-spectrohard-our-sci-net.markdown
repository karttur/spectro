## Introduktion

The non-profit (?) NGO (?) [Our Sci](https://www.our-sci.net) offers the 10 band general purpose [our sci reflectometer](https://www.our-sci.net/reflectometer/) at USD 475. It is built using a two broadband sensor and 10 different single wavelength LEDs ranging from 365 to 940 nm. The $ 475 kit includes a full suite of peripherals.

## Applications

While the spectrometer is for general purpose, the main application hitherto has been in soil science.

## Published study

In August 2021 a study of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in Africa used this spectrometer and showed that local spectral sampling was superior compared to the AfSIS and ISRIC soil grid data.
