## Introduction

The past decade and accelerating for the past years, have seen applications in using handheld spectral sensors. Most of the applications rely on visible (VIS) to Near Infra-Red (NIR) wavelength and either aborbance or reflectance spectroscopy. But a few eamples also use more advanced spectral techniques like fluorescence spectroscopy. This post summarizes an arbitrary selection of applications relying on spectral analysis using handheld devices.
