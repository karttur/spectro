## Introduction

The market for smart agriculture is growing exponentially and is estimated at around SEK 200 billion annually (www.statista.com). The market is driven by a top-down approach largely disregard geographical variations. Local knowledge and data on climate, soil and water conditions are ignored, while global or regional models are less accurate and can also give incorrect results. xSpectre handheld spectrometer is a tool for creating better models of soil and water conditions from satellite and drone images using local data and knowledge, and includes:
1. A handheld spectrometer with integrated sensors for ground properties (moisture, pH, hardness, etc.),
2. Smart mobile that acts as both a network solution and an app for controlling the spectrometer,
3. A mathematical / geometric method for both analysis and visualization of soil conditions from spectral data (patent application under development),
4. Direct connection between spectral 2D images of the landscape and the local models of land properties.

Soil properties can be collected in other ways than via the spectrometer with associated sensors, for example via fixed sensors or traditional soil samples. However, the spectrometer is relatively cheap and provides flexibility for measurement and also a low financial threshold for using advanced technology. The geometric calculation module translates spectra to earth properties and in the interface the model can be visualized and adjusted together with a map. Local users or professional experts can calibrate the model, by data or manually, with or without the help of AI, and the result is reflected directly in the map of the geographical area.

## Market potential

The users for whom we have presented our solution see two major benefits:
- Inclusion of geographical data and local knowledge in the models that translate spectral data (e.g. from drone and satellite images) into soil properties and soil measures to both improve harvest outcomes but also, for example, avoid nitrogen and phosphorus leakage to watercourses.
- The ability to independently test and evaluate, and even improve, currently available services and products based on spectral images. This applies to both individual farmers who can check, for example, the estimates of humidity obtained from consultants, or the estimates that the consultants receive from satellite data or drone the companies.

We believe that the benefit can be measured both in improved harvest results and reduced costs for efforts in the form of energy, fuel, irrigation and chemical pesticides. Consultants and image companies should be able to  increase the precision of their models and thereby increase their sales of services.


### Satellite operators

Companies or organisations that own and operate satellites that acquire multi-spectral images of the Earth's surface have a large interest in developing their products.

#### European Space Agency (ESA), Copernicus program

ESA operates a fleet of Earth observing satellites under the umbrella program Copernicus. Among these satellites, Sentinel-2 acquires bi-weekly multi-spectral images of the Earth's surface down to a spatial resolution of 10 m. We have been in contact with ESA and ESA partners and intend to seek funding from the __Future EO-1 Block 4
EO Science for Society Permanently Open Call for Proposals__ (deadline 29 October 2021).


#### National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Landsat program

The Landsat programme has been operational all the way back to 1972, acquiring approximately bi-weekly multispectral images of the Earth surface. All images are released to the public domain. We have not identified any specific third party funding opportunity directly linked to the Landsat program.

#### Maxar (DigitalGlobe)

Maxar is an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian remote sensing spacecraft. They build, operate and customise satellite sources information to public and private clients.

### Image service developers
