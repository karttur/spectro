## Intro

### MIR

#### Microhybrid

[Microhybrid](https://www.microhybrid.com/en/company/about-us/) have been developing and producing innovative microelectronics and infrared sensors for over 25 years. [Online shop in english](https://www.microhybrid.com/en/shop/).

[Microhybrid.com](https://www.microhybrid.com/) offers [1-4 band thermal (thermopile or IR) sensors](https://www.microhybrid.com/de/shop/thermische-ir-detektoren/), [IR emitters](https://www.microhybrid.com/de/shop/ir-strahler/) and [ready made dual-band IR spectrometers for gas sensing](https://www.microhybrid.com/de/shop/gassensoren/). they also offer a range of [bundled development products](https://www.microhybrid.com/de/shop/ndir-bundles/). For instance a bundle for [alcohol detection](https://www.microhybrid.com/en/shop/ir-emitter/ndir-bundle-oh/) applicable for use in wineries and small breweries.

#### Boston electronics

[Boston electronics](http://www.boselec.com/) offers (UV, Visible, to IR and THz photodetectors](https://www.boselec.com/product-category/ir-uv-thz-photodetectors/), [steady state IR emitters](http://www.boselec.com/product-category/ir-uv-sources/) and [?](#). they also offer a range of [?bundled development products](#).

The [thermopile (IR) sensors](http://www.boselec.com/product-category/infrared-ir-thermopile-pyroelectric-room-temperature-detectors/) are available as 1-4 band sensors housed as TO-8, TO-39, TO-46 packages.

[Boston electronics](http://www.boselec.com/) offers both broad band IR emitter and [IR LEDs](https://www.boselec.com/product-category/infrared-light-emitting-diodes-ir-led/) with center wavelengths from 1.9 to 7 microns.

The [Application Note NDIR-Measurement](https://www.boselec.com/wp-content/uploads/Linear/Heimann/HeimannLiterature/Application_Note_-_NDIR_Measurements.pdf) gives a clear overview of using [thermopile (IR) sensors](http://www.boselec.com/product-category/infrared-ir-thermopile-pyroelectric-room-temperature-detectors/) for detecting organic gas molecules.
